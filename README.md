# SuperStore-Sales

To effectively monitor and assess the superstoreâ€™s sales activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Superstore Sales Report. This report aims to provide insights into key sales-related metrics and their changes over time. By leveraging this report, we can make data-driven decisions, track our sales portfolio, and identify trends that will inform our sales strategies.
